# Preserved components and prototypes

This folder keeps useful branch assets intact so they are not lost during consolidation.

These files are not part of the default runnable path (`apps/api` + `apps/web`) but are
kept for reuse.

## Contents

- `ui-design-suhaan/` UI components extracted from `origin/UI-design/Suhaan`
- `swe/` UI/auth shell components extracted from `origin/swe`

The original branches remain unchanged on remote.
